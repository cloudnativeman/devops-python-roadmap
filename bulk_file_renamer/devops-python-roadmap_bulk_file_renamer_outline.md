# Project 1: Bulk File Renamer

## Goal
Rename all files in a directory to a new pattern (e.g., file1.txt, file2.txt).

## Steps
1. Ask user for directory path.
2. Ask for filename pattern (e.g., "img", "file").
3. List all files in the directory.
4. Loop and rename each file, keeping its extension.
5. Print summary.

## Learning Points
- User input (`input`)
- File and directory operations (`os`)
- Loops and string formatting
